    "paragraf1":"I created this project because I maintained a Minecraft server where I played with my friends and many times I needed to manage it when I was away from the computer. So I thought trying to use ssh from my iPhone is so lame, so I decided to build a rest API to be able to make an app for my mobile from which I could manage the server. I decided to use java because I thought it would be a language that any mod developer would feel comfortable with, however, I did not open the jar that Mojang offers but used it as a black box.What I did was build a Process thanks to the ProcessBuilder class and then use the input and output stream of the process to send messages to the server. In short, what I do is wrap the jar.",
